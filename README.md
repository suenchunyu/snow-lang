`Snow Lang` is a **Toy-Level** programming language writen in Go and implemented an interpreter for it.

# Why named 'Snow Lang'?

It' simple and crystal, `Snow` is the homonym of snowflakes in Chinese(`雪花`), and the `雪花` is homophonic for my
girlfriend's name in Chinese.

# Can I use `Snow Lang` for production?

Of course not. `Snow Lang` is just toy and I learn the compilers principle through it.

# Roadmap

- [x] Lexing and defining tokens.
- [x] Simple REPL.
- [x] Parsing `let` statements.
- [x] Parsing `return` statements.
- [x] Parsing expressions.
- [ ] Pratt Parsing algorithm.
- [ ] Read parse print loop.
- [ ] Evaluation.
- [ ] Interpreter Extending.
- [ ] Makefile build script.
- [ ] Evaluation codes from `*.snow` files.
- [ ] Releasing CI/CD scripts.

> Yeah, Long way to go. :)
